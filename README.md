### Analysis of dataset using different python libraries
The dataset provides an information about suicide cases all over the world. The main goal of the project is to inspect the trends and make predictions about future cases while also finding factors that influence the amount of suicide cases

### Dataset
The original dataset can be found on kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/szamil/who-suicide-statistics

### Run the project
Mind, that if you run the project on your own, you should have file who_suicide_statistics.csv in the same folder as the project, or you can try to replace the file name in project by the link to the dataset, which is not preffered due to technical issues.

There is also exists api command **kaggle datasets download -d szamil/who-suicide-statistics** but it has not proven working yet
